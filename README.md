# Financial forecasting using a BERT based sentiment index
This work is based on a Master Thesis by [Manuel Tonneau](https://github.com/mananeau) which in turn is based on:

Hiew, Joshua & Huang, Xin & Mou, Hao & Li, Duan & Wu, Qi & Xu, Yabo. (2019). [BERT-based Financial Sentiment Index and LSTM-based Stock Return Predictability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09024.pdf). 


You may use this repository as a foundation to develop alternative approaches and additional functionalities.

Other than work by Manuel Tonneau, this repository uses data from:

Malo, Pekka & Sinha, Ankur & Takala, Pyry & Korhonen, Pekka & Wallenius, Jyrki. (2013). FinancialPhraseBank-v1.0.
